The coupling is mediated by a non-hysteretic rf SQUID acting as a flux-tunable mutual inductance between the resonators. From the mode distance observed in spectroscopy experiments, we derive a coupling strength ranging between -320MHz and 37 MHz. In the case where the coupling strength is about zero, the microwave power cross transmission between the two resonators can be reduced by almost four orders of magnitude compared to the case where the coupling is switched on. In addition, we observe parametric amplification by applying a suitable additional drive tone.},

For the latter, we utilize a persistent current flux qubit. We characterize the tunable and switchable coupling in frequency and time domain and find that the coupling between the relevant modes can be varied in a controlled way. Specifically, the coupling can be tuned by adjusting the flux through the qubit loop or by saturating the qubit. Our time domain measurements allow us to find parameter regimes for optimal switch performance with respect to qubit drive power and the dynamic range of the resonator input power.},

@article{VanDenBrink2005,
abstract = {It is sketched how a monostable rf- or dc-SQUID can mediate an inductive coupling between two adjacent flux qubits. The non-trivial dependence of the SQUID's susceptibility on external flux makes it possible to continuously tune the induced coupling from antiferromagnetic (AF) to ferromagnetic (FM). In particular, for suitable parameters, the induced FM coupling can be sufficiently large to overcome any possible direct AF inductive coupling between the qubits. The main features follow from a classical analysis of the multi-qubit potential. A fully quantum treatment yields similar results, but with a modified expression for the SQUID susceptibility. Since the latter is exact, it can also be used to evaluate the susceptibility - or, equivalently, energy-level curvature - of an isolated rf-SQUID for larger shielding and at degenerate flux bias, i.e., a (bistable) qubit. The result is compared to the standard two-level (pseudospin) treatment of the anticrossing, and the ensuing conclusions are verified numerically. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

These operations, when applied properly, can robustly generate entanglement and squeezing for the quantum resonator modes. Here, we present such coupling schemes between a nanomechanical resonator and a superconducting electrical resonator using applied microwave voltages as well as between two superconducting lumped-element electrical resonators using a r.f. SQUID-mediated tunable coupler. By calculating the logarithmic negativity of the partially transposed density matrix, we quantitatively study the entanglement generated at finite temperatures. We also show that characterization of the nanomechanical resonator state after the quantum operations can be achieved by detecting the electrical resonator only. Thus, one of the electrical resonator modes can act as a probe to measure the entanglement of the coupled systems and the degree of squeezing for the other resonator mode.},

There, switchable coupling between two superconducting resonators is mediated by a superconducting qubit operating in the dispersive regime, where the qubit transition frequency is far detuned from those of the resonators. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for the quantum switch beyond the rotating wave approximation and study the dissipative dynamics within a Bloch-Redfield quantum master equation approach. We derive analytically how the qubit affects the quantum switch even if the qubit has no dynamics, and we estimate the strength of this influence. The analytical results are corroborated by numerical calculations, where coherent oscillations between the resonators, the decay of coherent and Fock states, and the decay of resonator-resonator entanglement are studied. Finally, we suggest an experimental protocol for extracting the damping constants of qubit and resonators by measuring the quadratures of the resonator fields.},

This storage resonator is addressed through a second, coupling resonator, which is frequency-tunable and controlled by a magnetic flux applied to a superconducting quantum interference device. We experimentally demonstrate that the lifetime of the storage resonator can be tuned by more than three orders of magnitude. A field can be stored for 18 ls when the coupling resonator is tuned off resonance and it can be released in 14 ns when the coupling resonator is tuned on resonance.

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4882646] At the interface between quantum optics and integrated electronics, superconducting circuits constitute a flexible and scalable platform for quantum information processing based on the manipulation of qubits and microwave photons. 1–3 One of the main challenges is to develop basic tools required to manipulate photons at the single photon level. Such func-tionalities include, for instance, photon generation, 4 detec-tion, routing, 5 and storage. 6 A scalable architecture of a circuit quantum electrody-namics (circuit-QED) experiment can have the structure of a quantum network. 7 In this scheme, propagating photons car-rying bits of quantum information travel between nodes where quantum information is processed through the interac-tion of these photons with various quantum systems. Such quantum systems can be superconducting quantum bits, spin ensembles, quantum dots, or mechanical oscillators. Despite recent progress in achieving a strong coupling with propagat-ing photons, it is convenient to embed the quantum system in a cavity where its coupling to the field is resonantly enhanced.},

@article{Harris2010,
abstract = {A superconducting chip containing a regular array of flux qubits, tunable interqubit inductive couplers, an XY-addressable readout system, on-chip programmable magnetic memory, and a sparse network of analog control lines has been studied. The architecture of the chip and the infrastructure used to control it were designed to facilitate the implementation of an adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm. The performance of an eight-qubit unit cell on this chip has been characterized by measuring its success in solving a large set of random Ising spin-glass problem instances as a function of temperature. The experimental data are consistent with the predictions of a quantum mechanical model of an eight-qubit system coupled to a thermal environment. These results highlight many of the key practical challenges that we have overcome and those that lie ahead in the quest to realize a functional large-scale adiabatic quantum information processor. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Ivakhnenko2018,
abstract = {A quantum system can be driven by either sinusoidal, rectangular, or noisy signals. In the literature, these regimes are referred to as Landau-Zener-St{\"{u}}ckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry, latching modulation, and motional averaging, respectively. We demonstrate that these pronounced and interesting effects are also inherent in the dynamics of classical two-state systems. We discuss how such classical systems are realized using either mechanical, electrical, or optical resonators. In addition to the fundamental interest of such dynamical phenomena linking classical and quantum physics, we believe that these are attractive for the classical analogue simulation of quantum systems.},

@article{Novotny2010,
abstract = {Strongly interacting quantum systems are at the heart of many physical processes, ranging from photosynthesis to quantum information. We demonstrate that many characteristic features of strongly coupled systems can be derived classically for a simple coupled harmonic oscillator. This model system is used to derive frequency splittings and to analyze adiabatic and diabatic transitions between the coupled states. A classical analog of the Landau–Zener formula is derived. The classical analysis is intuitive and well suited for introducing students to the basic concepts of strongly interacting systems.},

abstract = {We investigate analytically the coupling of a coplanar waveguide resonator to a coplanar waveguide feedline. Using a conformal mapping technique we obtain an expression for the characteristic mode impedances and coupling coefficients of an asymmetric multi-conductor transmission line. Leading order terms for the external quality factor and frequency shift are calculated. The obtained analytical results are relevant for designing circuit-QED quantum systems and frequency division multiplexing of superconducting bolometers, detectors and similar microwave-range multi-pixel devices.},
